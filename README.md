#HRT-2020winter-vacation-stud-log


Followed by the spirit of GNU, I'd like to share my knowledge and study log to public. In this repository, I shared my track of learning power source circuit and eventually deveoping PDM(Power Distribution Module). Hope you can learn something from my experience and create more powerful product.
